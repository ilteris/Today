# Today

instructions.

make sure you have cocoapods installed on your system. if not, please install it. (brew install cocoapod should do it, if not, refer to google) then run

clone the repo, 

`pod install`

Also, I have snap as submodule for now, run `git submodule update` that should make it work, if not refer to its repository.

Sorry about that, I will move it to pods soon.

`open xcworkspace Today.xcworkspace/` finally and compile.
